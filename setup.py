## This setup.py will build CVC4 using the CMake arguments in cmake_args below
## This is primarily intended for building Python wheels to be uploaded to PyPi.
## If you are installing from source, this is not the recommended way to build
## CVC4 (it does not allow you to customize the options and it will hide the
## build folder). Please instead use the main approach:
##
## ./configure.sh [your options] --python-bindings
## (since you're looking at this setup.py, you probably want python bindings)
## cd build
## make
##

from skbuild import setup

setup(
    name="pycvc4",
    version="1.9.0",
    license="BSD",
    packages=['pycvc4'],
    package_dir={
        'pycvc4': 'src/api/pycvc4'},
