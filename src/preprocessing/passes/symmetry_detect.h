 * This class stores a "partition", which is a way of representing a

 *
 * For example, when finding symmetries for a term like x+y = 0, we
 * construct a partition { w -> { x, y } } that indicates that automorphisms
 * over { x, y } do not affect the satisfiability of this term. In this
 * example, we have the following assignments to the members of this class:
 *   d_term : x+y=0
 *   d_sterm : w+w=0
 *   d_var_to_subvar : { x -> w, y -> w }
 *   d_subvar_to_vars : { w -> { x, y } }
 * We often identify a partition with its d_subvar_to_vars field.
 *
 * We call w a "symmetry breaking variable".

/** partition merger
 *
 * This class is used to identify sets of children of commutative operators k
 * that are identical up to a set of automorphisms.
 *
 * This class is used when we have detected symmetries for the children
 * of a term t of the form <k>( t_1, ..., t_n ), where k is a commutative
 * operator. For each i=1,...n, partitions[i] represents symmetries (in the
 * form of a partition) computed for the child t_i.
 *
 * The vector d_indices of this class stores a list ( i_1...i_m ) such that
 * ( t_i_j * partition[i_j].d_var_to_subvar ) is syntactically equivalent
 * for each j=1...m, where * is application of substitution.
 *
 * In detail, we say that
 *   partition[j1] = { w -> X_1 },
 *   ...,
 *   partition[jp] = { w -> X_p }
 * are mergeable if s=|X_1|=...=|X_p|, and all subsets of
 * X* = ( union_{k=1...p} X_k ) of size s are equal to exactly one of
 * X_1 ... X_p.
